# Project NOVA: Advanced Land Cover Segmentation and Uncertainty Analytics

Project NOVA is a state-of-the-art remote sensing analytics framework that leverages advanced deep learning techniques to enhance land cover mapping for NASA applications. By combining robust segmentation models with uncertainty quantification and patch-level analysis, NOVA delivers actionable insights that guide data-driven decision-making and model refinement.

## Overview

Project NOVA is designed to:
- **Process Multi-Resolution Data:** Ingest and preprocess imagery from multiple satellite sources (e.g., PlanetScope, Landsat, Sentinel-2).
- **Generate Enhanced Visualizations:** Create false-color composites and interactive visualizations to clearly represent land cover details.
- **Segmentation Modeling:** Train a U-Net-based segmentation model in TensorFlow/Keras, incorporating Monte Carlo dropout to estimate prediction uncertainty.
- **Patch-Level Analysis:** Divide segmented images into patches to assess local performance metrics (e.g., Dice Coefficient, IoU) and quantify uncertainty.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide detailed analyses and recommendations for targeted data augmentation, preprocessing refinement, and adaptive modeling strategies.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Automated generation of false-color composites and preparation of multi-resolution satellite imagery.
  
- **Deep Learning Segmentation:**  
  Implementation of a U-Net model for semantic segmentation, enhanced with Monte Carlo dropout to capture uncertainty.

- **Patch-Level Performance Metrics:**  
  Granular analysis of segmentation quality across image patches, identifying regions with high uncertainty and lower performance.

- **Visualization and Analysis:**  
  Interactive plots (scatter plots, histograms) and comprehensive performance metrics (Dice, Jaccard, ROC AUC) to evaluate model outputs.

- **Actionable Recommendations:**  
  Detailed conclusions and future directions to guide improvements in data collection, preprocessing, and modeling.
